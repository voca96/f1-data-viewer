This App is a side project to see F1 simple data using OpenF1 API's and has just for educational propuse, this project don't have a commercial propurse and is open code!

Delimitation:

    1 Connect to the openF1 API âœ…
    2 Brings all the drivers/pilot of specific seasson (Is not posible on an easy way due the stucture of the API, It could be brought per session/Race)
    3 Show all the info of an specific driver and the record of the last or current seasson (Create fixed data)
    4 Bring all the info about each circuit metting, just the race session
    5 In a graph show the position of each driver/pilot in each lap

NOTE: there are some limitation with the api data and the information structure that they provide, also they just provide the seassons 2023(incomplete data) and 2024


Consideration:
I have to create some fixed data that complement the APIs data for create a better experience

    Ex: Data about each team and images about team and cars

Also there are not data about the position of each pilot in each lap, soo I have to treat the pilot position on a diferent way due the APIs just offer the time when they get the new position, for create a graph I have to compared each time of each other pilot.
